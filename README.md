# Drug Performance Evaluation

## Overview

This repository focuses on the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and visualization of the Drug Performance Evaluation dataset. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains information about various drugs, including their conditions, indications, types, and customer reviews. The project provides a structured workflow for cleaning the original dataset, performing exploratory data analysis, and creating insightful visualizations.
## Repository Structure

- **`starting_file/`**: Contains the original dataset from Kaggle.
  - `drug_starting.csv`: The raw data file downloaded from Kaggle.
  - 
- **`starting_file_analysis/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebook for cleaning and transforming the starting file.
  - `drug_cleaning_df.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook documenting the process of importing the starting file, cleaning, and analyzing it, and exporting the cleaned dataset.
 
  - **`cleaned_starting_file/`**: Contains the cleaned dataset exported from the ETL process.
  - `drugs_cleaned.csv`: The cleaned and processed dataset, ready for analysis.

- **`graphs/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualizations.
  - `graphs.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook documenting the process of cleaning and transforming the starting file, and creating visualizations.

## Usage

Explore the cleaned dataset and leverage the insights gained from the analysis. The Jupyter Notebooks serve as comprehensive guides, providing transparency into the ETL process and visualization techniques applied to the Drug Performance Evaluation dataset.
